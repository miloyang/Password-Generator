# Password-Generator

## Description

This week's challenge allows the bootcamp students to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To see the Javascript code, you can copy and paste this link into your browser: https://miloyang.github.io/Password-Generator

The page should open as per below screenshots:

The Javascript code can be seen when you open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. Head into the Console tab, and there you will see the code. 

When you click on the button to generate a password, you will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.  
When prompted for the length of the password, you will be able to choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
The other prompts will include selection such as the inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters. 
After each prompt is answered, the input will be validated. At least one character type needs to be selected. 
When all prompts are answered, a password that matches the selected criteria will be generated, and is displayed in an alert. 
The page will have a responsive layout that adapts the viewport, when you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices.
